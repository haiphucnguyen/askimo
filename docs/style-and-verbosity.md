# 🎨 Adjusting Style & Verbosity in Askimo

Askimo lets you customize how responses are generated by adjusting two parameters:

Style → controls the tone and creativity of responses.

Verbosity → controls the length and level of detail.

These settings help you balance precision vs creativity and brevity vs depth depending on your task.

## ⚙️ Parameters
1. style

`Enum(precise | balanced | creative) – default: balanced`

* precise → Factual, deterministic, concise. Best for technical or structured tasks.

* balanced → A mix of clarity and readability. Best for general use.

* creative → Imaginative, expressive, and exploratory. Best for brainstorming and ideation.

---

2. verbosity

`Enum(short | normal | long) – default: normal`

* short → Minimal answer (good for quick checks or saving tokens).

* normal → Standard explanation with key details.

* long → Extended explanation with background, examples, and context.

## 📖 Guidelines for Use

* Use precise + short for data lookups or quick factual answers.

* Use balanced + normal (default) for everyday Q&A.

* Use creative + long for brainstorming, teaching, or storytelling.

Remember: higher verbosity may increase cost and response time.
