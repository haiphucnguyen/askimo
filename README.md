## 🚀 What is Askimo?

**Askimo is your personal AI assistant that works on your computer - not in your browser.** Chat with different AI models (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) all in one place, without worrying about losing your conversations when you close a tab.

Think of it as having multiple AI assistants in one app: use Claude for coding, ChatGPT for conversation, and a free local model for quick emails. Everything is saved on your machine - no cloud storage required.
